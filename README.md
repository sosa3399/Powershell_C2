## Powershell_C2

A basic Powershell C2 that I made some time ago and how to build it

## Requierments
You'll need to install powershell on [Linux](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-linux?view=powershell-7.3) or you can simply build it on a Windows machine. 

You'll also need [Invoke-Obfuscation](https://github.com/danielbohannon/Invoke-Obfuscation) in order to obfuscate the code (this will help with the endpoint evasion, but It's not granted to work). Back when I tested it, I used AST type obfuscation, this might not work now.    

## Installation
Git clone this repository, and read the comments on the code

### notes

6 months ago more or less was not detected by Windows Defender, it might have changed, haven't had the opportunity to test it right now. In a near future I'll make a python program to make the installation easier.
